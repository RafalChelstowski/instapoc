# Project Progress Update

## Video Capture and Instagram Messaging Integration

- Implemented webcam video capture and recording in the React webapp.
- Added functionality in the React app to send recorded video as multipart/form-data to the backend API.
- Updated backend webhook (`api/webhook.js`) to parse multipart form data using `busboy`.
- Backend uploads received video to Instagram's media endpoint and sends it as a video message attachment.
- Preserved existing text message sending and Instagram webhook event handling.
- Added new dependencies: `busboy` and `form-data`.
- Environment variables required: `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `VERIFY_TOKEN`, `IG_BUSINESS_ID`.

## Next Steps

- Test the full video message sending flow end-to-end.
- Handle edge cases and errors in video upload and messaging.
- Improve UI feedback for video upload and message sending status.
- Consider adding video recording time limits and file size checks.
